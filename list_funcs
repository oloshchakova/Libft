• isalpha 											
checks  for an alphabetic character; in the standard "C" locale,
              it is equivalent to (isupper(c) ||  islower(c)).   In  some  lo‐

NAME
       memset - fill memory with a constant byte

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memset()  function  fills  the  first  n  bytes of the memory area
       pointed to by s with the constant byte c.

RETURN VALUE
       The memset() function returns a pointer to the memory area s.

===================================================================================
• bzero
NAME
       bzero, explicit_bzero - zero a byte string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <strings.h>

       void bzero(void *s, size_t n);

       #include <string.h>

       void explicit_bzero(void *s, size_t n);
DESCRIPTION
       The  bzero()  function  erases  the  data  in the n bytes of the memory
       starting at the location pointed to by s, by writing zeros (bytes  con‐
       taining '\0') to that area.

       The  explicit_bzero()  function  performs the same task as bzero().  It
       differs from bzero() in that it guarantees that compiler  optimizations
       will  not  remove  the erase operation if the compiler deduces that the
       operation is "unnecessary".

RETURN VALUE
       None.

===================================================================================
• memcpy
NAME
       memcpy - copy memory area

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memcpy()  function  copies  n bytes from memory area src to memory
       area dest.  The memory areas must not overlap.  Use memmove(3)  if  the
       memory areas do overlap.

RETURN VALUE
       The memcpy() function returns a pointer to dest.

===================================================================================
• memmove
NAME
       memmove - copy memory area

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memmove()  function  copies n bytes from memory area src to memory
       area dest.  The memory areas may overlap: copying takes place as though
       the  bytes in src are first copied into a temporary array that does not
       overlap src or dest, and the bytes are then copied from  the  temporary
       array to dest.

RETURN VALUE
       The memmove() function returns a pointer to dest.

===================================================================================
• strlcpy				C02_ex10						
• strlcat			       C03_ex05							
NAME
     strlcpy, strlcat — size-bounded string copying and concatenation

LIBRARY
     Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <string.h>
     (See libbsd(7) for include usage.)

     size_t
     strlcpy(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);

     size_t
     strlcat(char *dst, const char *src, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
     The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy and concatenate strings re‐
     spectively.  They are designed to be safer, more consistent, and less er‐
     ror prone replacements for strncpy(3) and strncat(3).  Unlike those func‐
     tions, strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the buffer (not just
     the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result (as long as size is
     larger than 0 or, in the case of strlcat(), as long as there is at least
     one byte free in dst).  Note that a byte for the NUL should be included
     in size.  Also note that strlcpy() and strlcat() only operate on true “C”
     strings.  This means that for strlcpy() src must be NUL-terminated and
     for strlcat() both src and dst must be NUL-terminated.

     The strlcpy() function copies up to size - 1 characters from the NUL-ter‐
     minated string src to dst, NUL-terminating the result.

     The strlcat() function appends the NUL-terminated string src to the end
     of dst.  It will append at most size - strlen(dst) - 1 bytes, NUL-termi‐
     nating the result.

RETURN VALUES
     The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions return the total length of the
     string they tried to create.  For strlcpy() that means the length of src.
     For strlcat() that means the initial length of dst plus the length of
     src.  While this may seem somewhat confusing, it was done to make trunca‐
     tion detection simple.

     Note, however, that if strlcat() traverses size characters without find‐
     ing a NUL, the length of the string is considered to be size and the des‐
     tination string will not be NUL-terminated (since there was no space for
     the NUL).  This keeps strlcat() from running off the end of a string.  In
     practice this should not happen (as it means that either size is incor‐
     rect or that dst is not a proper “C” string).  The check exists to pre‐
     vent potential security problems in incorrect code.

• toupper +C02_ex07										
These functions convert lowercase letters to uppercase.

===================================================================================
• tolower +C02_ex08										
These functions convert uppercase letters to lowercase.

===================================================================================
• strchr											
• strrchr	
SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strchr(const char *s, int c);

       char *strrchr(const char *s, int c);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the
       character c in the string s.

       The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of  the
       character c in the string s.

       Here "character" means "byte"; these functions do not work with wide or
       multibyte characters.

RETURN VALUE
       The strchr() and strrchr() functions return a pointer  to  the  matched
       character  or NULL if the character is not found.  The terminating null
       byte is considered part of the string, so that if  c  is  specified  as
       '\0', these functions return a pointer to the terminator.
===================================================================================
• strncmp +C03										
NAME
       strcmp, strncmp - compare two strings

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int strcmp(const char *s1, const char *s2);

       int strncmp(const char *s1, const char *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  The locale is not taken into account (for a locale-
       aware comparison, see strcoll(3)).  It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if  s1  is
       found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.

       The strncmp() function is similar, except it compares only the first (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The strcmp() and strncmp() functions return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 (or the
       first n bytes thereof) is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.
===================================================================================
• memchr
NAME
       memchr, memrchr, rawmemchr - scan memory for a character

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       void *memchr(const void *s, int c, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memchr()  function scans the initial n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s for the first instance of
       c.  Both c and the bytes of the memory area pointed to by s are interpreted as unsigned char.

RETURN VALUE
       The  memchr() function return a pointer to the matching byte or NULL if the character does not
       occur in the given memory area.

===================================================================================
• memcmp
NAME
       memcmp - compare memory areas

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       int memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  memcmp()  function  compares the first n bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the memory areas s1
       and s2.

RETURN VALUE
       The memcmp() function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the first n bytes of  s1
       is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the first n bytes of s2.

       For  a  nonzero  return  value, the sign is determined by the sign of the difference between the first pair of
       bytes (interpreted as unsigned char) that differ in s1 and s2.

       If n is zero, the return value is zero.
===================================================================================
• strnstr											
SYNOPSIS
#include <string.h>
char 	*strstr (const char *big, const char *little)
char 	*strnstr (const char *big, const char *little, size_t len)

DESCRIPTION
The strstr function locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string \c little in the null-terminated string \c big.
The strnstr function locates the first occurrence of the null-terminated string \c little in the string \c big, where not more than \c len characters are searched. Characters that appear after a \0 character are not searched. Since the strnstr function is a FreeBSD specific API, it should only be used when portability is not a concern.

RETURN VALUE
If little is an empty string, big is returned; if little occurs nowhere in big, NULL is returned; otherwise a pointer to the first character of the first occurrence of little is returned.

Example - Locate a substring in a string
Problem
The following sets the pointer ptr to the "Bar Baz" portion of largestring:
Workings
const char *largestring = "Foo Bar Baz";
const char *smallstring = "Bar";
char *ptr;
 
ptr = strstr(largestring, smallstring);
===================================================================================
• atoi +C04_ex03										
NAME
       atoi, atol, atoll - convert a string to an integer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       int atoi(const char *nptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr to int.  The behavior is the
       same as

           strtol(nptr, NULL, 10);

       except that atoi() does not detect errors.

       The atol() and atoll() functions behave the same as atoi(), except that they convert the  initial  portion  of
       the string to their return type of long or long long.

RETURN VALUE
       The converted value.
===================================================================================
malloc():
• calloc
NAME
       malloc, free, calloc, realloc - allocate and free dynamic memory

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdlib.h>

       void *malloc(size_t size);
       void free(void *ptr);
       void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);

DESCRIPTION
       The  malloc()  function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.  The memory is not
       initialized.  If size is 0, then malloc() returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value  that  can  later  be
       successfully passed to free().

       The free() function frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a previous call
       to malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().  Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before, undefined be‐
       havior occurs.  If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

       The calloc() function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer
       to the allocated memory.  The memory is set to zero.  If nmemb or size is  0,  then  calloc()  returns  either
       NULL,  or  a  unique  pointer value that can later be successfully passed to free().  If the multiplication of
       nmemb and size would result in integer overflow, then calloc() returns an  error.   By  contrast,  an  integer
       overflow  would  not  be detected in the following call to malloc(), with the result that an incorrectly sized
       block of memory would be allocated:

           malloc(nmemb * size);

RETURN VALUE
       The malloc() and calloc() functions return a pointer to the allocated memory, which is  suitably  aligned  for
       any  built-in type.  On error, these functions return NULL.  NULL may also be returned by a successful call to
       malloc() with a size of zero, or by a successful call to calloc() with nmemb or size equal to zero.

       The free() function returns no value.											
• strdup

NAME
       strdup, strndup, strdupa, strndupa - duplicate a string

SYNOPSIS
       #include <string.h>

       char *strdup(const char *s);

DESCRIPTION
       The  strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string s.  Memory for the
       new string is obtained with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3).

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the strdup() function returns a pointer to the duplicated string.  It returns NULL if insufficient
       memory was available, with errno set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       ENOMEM Insufficient memory available to allocate duplicate string.
